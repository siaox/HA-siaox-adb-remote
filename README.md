![Remote](https://i.ibb.co/m9DZ49L/Screenshot-2021-10-27-at-21-14-30-Overview-Home-Assistant.png)


**Description**

This is a glance card for a remote used for home assistant. Basically used the glace card to run scripts to activate ADB commands. 
It also works with (probably anything you could yaml properly) logitech harmony commands or broadlink commands.



**ADB Requirements**
1. Have ADB Commands setup to your Home Assistant accessible Android Device using [ADB Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv/)
2. Create Scripts for ADB commands [More Info](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/)



**Installation**

1. Create script for buttons  
2. Add yaml from Remote Glance Card.yaml

I'm slightly drunk will update this eventually.

I'm pretty sure we can make this faster - please let me know how.

Thank you HA.
